# Database Independence Implementation

This document records the changes made to implement a database-independent approach in the Seating application.

## Architecture Changes

1. **Database Abstraction Layer**
   - Implemented a centralized `db` object in `lib/db.ts` that provides a consistent interface for all data operations
   - Created standard methods for each data type (food, seats, guests)
   - Initial implementation uses an in-memory store with the ability to swap for any database

2. **API Route Updates**
   - Updated all API routes to use the `db` object instead of direct Prisma calls
   - Standardized error handling and response formats across all endpoints
   - Ensured consistent HTTP method usage (GET, POST, PUT) across endpoints

3. **Client-Side Storage**
   - Enhanced client-side storage utility with improved caching and error handling
   - Implemented consistent localStorage fallback for offline usage
   - Added event dispatch for real-time updates across components

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/db.ts` - Core database abstraction implementation
- `src/app/api/food/route.ts` - Food selection API routes
- `src/app/api/seats/route.ts` - Seat selection API routes
- `src/app/api/guests/route.ts` - Guest counter API routes
- `src/app/api/guests/reset/route.ts` - Guest reset API route
- `src/app/api/reset/route.ts` - Complete reset API route
- `src/app/api/cron/reset/route.ts` - Automated reset API for cron jobs
- `src/utils/storage.ts` - Client-side storage utility with API integration

## Memory Store Structure

```typescript
const memoryStore = {
  foodOptions: new Map<string, FoodOption>(),
  seatSelections: new Map<string, boolean>(),
  guestData: { count: 0, lastReset: new Date().toISOString() }
}
```

## Database Interface

The standardized interface for database operations:

```typescript
export const db = {
  food: {
    getAll: async () => FoodOption[],
    update: async (id: string, selected: boolean) => FoodOption,
    reset: async () => void
  },
  seats: {
    getAll: async () => SeatSelection[],
    update: async (position: string, selected: boolean) => SeatSelection,
    reset: async () => void
  },
  guests: {
    get: async () => { count: number, lastReset: string },
    update: async (count: number) => { count: number, lastReset: string },
    reset: async () => { count: number, lastReset: string }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: The application can now work with any database backend by simply implementing the interface
2. **Testability**: Easier to test components and API routes with mock data stores
3. **Development**: Simple in-memory store for development without database setup
4. **Scalability**: Ability to migrate to different database solutions without changing application code
5. **Offline Support**: Enhanced offline capabilities with localStorage fallback

## Future Improvements

1. Implement database adapters for popular databases:
   - MongoDB adapter
   - PostgreSQL adapter
   - Redis adapter
   
2. Add database connection configuration via environment variables
3. Implement database migrations system for schema changes
